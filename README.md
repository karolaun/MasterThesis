The codes in this repository are all part of a Master Thesis in Mechanical Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. 

The Thesis will explore new data collection methods for lower-limb prostheses, whereby OpenCV and computer vision technologies have proved very useful. 

Some codes are heavily influenced by other GitHub pages, and these pages and creators will be linked in cases where this is relevant. Some of the code is also taken from the OpenCV library, available here: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html

The codes are put in the repository to illustrate the process of developing a program, not to claim as the author's own work in its entirety.
