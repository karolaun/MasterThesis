The codes in this repository are all part of a Master Thesis in Mechanical Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. 

The Thesis will explore new data collection methods for lower-limb prostheses, whereby OpenCV and computer vision technologies have proved very useful. 

Some codes are heavily influenced by other GitHub pages, and these pages and creators will be linked in cases where this is relevant.
